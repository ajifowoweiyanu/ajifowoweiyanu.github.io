This review explores the growing use of reinforcement learning (RL) in HVAC systems to enhance energy efficiency and occupant comfort. We discuss the primary RL algorithms, their implementation in building control, and the significant challenges that researchers face, including scalability and real-world deployment. The paper provides a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners interested in AI-driven building automation.
